# User authentication for voice-based services
This project contains a prototype for a user study created in conjunction with a master's thesis on User authentication for voice-based services - A user study of the usability and perceived security of Authentication Methods.
The prototype includes a voice service based on Google Assistant. The repository contains a backup of the [Dialogflow voice agent](agent/VoiceBank.zip) and also the [source code](routes/) for the developed webhooks. Additionally, the raw data of the results from the user study is provided as an [excel file](UserStudyData.xlsx).
